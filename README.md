# External Content with Completion #
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lushonline/moodle-mod_externalcontent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lushonline/moodle-mod_externalcontent)

The module enables a teacher to create a resource using the text editor.

The resource can display text, images, sound, video and web links.

Advantages of using the External content module rather than the standard page module is
that optionally if the content has links to an external site that records a completion status
the completion can then be imported using [moodle-tool_uploadexternalcontentresults](https://github.com/lushonline/moodle-tool_uploadexternalcontentresults)
